Synchronous means Line by Line if one line take time then next lines will be waiting for that line
of code to execute. it is not good at all.

Synchronous means Blocking the code.

Asynchronous means Non Blocking the code.
Fetch Request is Asynchronous Javascript Example.

Node JS is Single Threaded Language

so when any javascript code is running it will be taking only single thread from cpu memory.

When many user is using one Node Application, there will be only one thread for all user so code must be Asynchronous
so one user not block other users task or processes.

if it Synchronous then for one user all other users will have to wait for execution to finish.

Asynchronous mean Non Blocking I/O Model.
in asynchronous code we use callback function to perform the task and
like if this process finish do this and so on.
