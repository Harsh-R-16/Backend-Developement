A browser is known as Client and it sends requests to Server.
Server give HTML, CSS, JavaScript and browser build web page from that Files.

It is called Request Response Model or Client Server Model

Client requests from Different URLs and
Url contains Protocol / Domain Name / Resource
https://www.google.com/maps 

google or domain name is not name of server but it is just easy name for users to use.
actually we will be sending requests to google ip address
DNS converts Domain Name to Server Address.

Our Internet Service Provider converts domain to actual server address
DNS converts Domain Name to real IP address of Server Address

we write http://www.google.com but DNS converts to real IP address of Server
like https://216.58.211.158:443

this works on TCP/IP protocol.
