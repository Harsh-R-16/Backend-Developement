How we communicate on internet.

in real life we communicate with pyhsical address.

in address location name could be same but pincode always different from other pincodes.

on internet communication we send http requests

http requests contains always headers.

Headers contains IP address.

255.255.255.255 

Sneder IP address and Receiver IP address

we required also port number of the receiver and sender.
ip address and port number is must in communication on internet.

we will have range of port number. by default is 3000.

Client Server architecture
Client means frontend and Server means Backend.

1 tier vs 2 tier.

when client and server is in one system then it is 1 tier architecture
when client and server is in two different systems it is 2 tier architecture.

2 tier architecture is good for server

business logic and frontend is different in 2 tier architecture.

thread means processor for computational power.

module means chunk of code for performing particular tasks.

module types

- custom module (we created and exported)
- core module (inbuilt modules like http or fs)
- thirt party module (we import to use this)

port is logical door to server.

so when i call in company it say me type 1 to talk with person1
type 2 for talking with person2 and so on

so Phone Number is same but output is different .

so on computer many port are there for running different applications
so base is same but ports are different

computer is same but port is different.

So port listen activity on that port what user is requesting for.
