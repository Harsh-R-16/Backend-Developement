We need Database to store data permenent for future use.
we can store data in memory while programming is running but for permenent storage we use databases.
SQL and NoSQL are databases

SQL in form of table and NoSQL in form object.

in SQL we have One Database and in has many tables which are related to each others.

in SQL structure is always there before inserting data.

in NoSQL we use collection

collection and document in NoSQL.
Structure not matter in NoSQL Database.
Database --> collection --> document

below is one collection containing 2 documents
{
    "Name":"Harsh",
    "Age":20
},
{
    "First Name":"Harsh",
    "Age":20
}
key called field.

in SQL we required to give Schema but NoSQL is flexible we and any field in database.
SQL field must be same where in NoSQL database field can br radical different

Scaling Vertical vs Horizontal 

Database contains collection in NoSQL and collections contains documents.
Database contains tables in SQL and tables contains rows.
