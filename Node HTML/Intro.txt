we need dependencies while built environment when we create run build then all dependencies code imported in main file.

nodemon is runtime dependencies

version number 1.1.1

major version.minor version.patch version
patch version(minor bugs fix)
new change but not major change(minor version)

npm outdated to see any outdated packages in our projects.
if all packages are up to date then it will give no output.

for installing perticaler version package we use the version number
like npm install express@1.1.2 something like that 

and now run npm outdated it will list express current version and latest version

npm uninstall packagename for uninstalling package
